# About "Ka-ming" aka Victor

I am a **Data Scientist** studying the impacts of natural processes and human activities on **air quality**, **food security**, **environmental health**, and **climate change**, using advanced tools like **process-based models** ([CESM](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/), [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/), [DNDC](http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/)) and **machine learning**.

I graduated with a Ph.D. from [Prof. Amos Tai's group](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/sci/essc/tgabi/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)) in 2019. I then worked with [Prof. Colette Heald's group](https://www.healdgroupmit.com/) as a Postdoctoral Associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology([MIT](https://mit.edu)) until 2021. I am currently a Data Scientist at a management consulting firm.

I use my Cantonese name ["Ka Ming Fung"](post/2019-09-03-about-ka-ming/) for my academic publications, though I am also known as **Victor**.
