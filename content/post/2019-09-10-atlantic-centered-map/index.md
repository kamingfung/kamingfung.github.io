This is an example to plot a world map with Atlantic centered map using
R and ggplot2.

``` r
library(ggplot2) # for plotting

ggplot() + borders("world2") + coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) + theme_bw()
```

…and with a bit more informative axes.

``` r
library(scales)  # for formatting axes labels

ggplot() + borders("world2") + coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) + theme_bw() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(90, 180, 270), labels = label_number(suffix = "ºE")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(-60, -30, 0, 30, 60), labels = label_number(suffix = "ºN"))
```

You can then add other geometry object onto the maps.
