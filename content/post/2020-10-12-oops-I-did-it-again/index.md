I did it again. A day after my Jekyll-generated site is launched, I discovered Hugo, another SSG (static site generator) written in Go :sparkle:. Six hours later, my Hugo-powered site is up and running. Here in this post, I am explaining why.

### Dr. J and Mr. H

* **Hugo is Faster** - website generating is a process of conversion from a collection of scripts into html and other media files for website hosts. With multimedia content, such as pictures and videos, Jekyll took 8 seconds to render my site vs Hugo's <1 second. Some users tested that Hugo can generate 600k pages within 5 minutes.

* **Hugo is Neater** - I forked my site from [Wowchemy's Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic). This template groups all all relevant contents, including source markdown scripts, pictures etc. of each post/page under individual folders. On the contrary, the Jekyll al-folio classify required files by file types

* **Hugo is Newer** - one long page, fast scrolling, no BS. Just like Insta. :camera:



### Jekyll for flexibility
Based on Ruby, Jekyll is still a more customizable tool for website builders. It encourages users to add contents using HTML, liquid syntax, and markdown all at once, sounding perfect for picky geeks :nerd_face:.
