Hi there! My last name is "Fung" (馮), and my first name is "Ka Ming" (家銘), which is actually two words. In Cantonese, my name is written as "Fung Ka Ming". However, according to Chinese naming customs, the family name should come first, so my full birth name is "Fung Ka Ming".

Because of the British-style education system in Hong Kong, some people here have adopted English names as nicknames, and I go by "Victor".

As for my academic identity, I've chosen to use "Ka Ming FUNG". I want to show my appreciation to my parents for choosing my birth name, and also to promote and preserve the Cantonese language.
