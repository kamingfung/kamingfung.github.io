Hi there! :wave: My last name is "Fung" (馮), and my first name is "Ka Ming" (家銘). In Chinese culture, the family name comes first, so my full birth name is "Fung Ka Ming" (馮家銘).

Because of the British-style education system in Hong Kong, some people here have adopted English names as nicknames, and I go by "Victor".

As for my academic identity, I've chosen to use "Ka Ming FUNG". I want to show my appreciation to my parents for choosing my birth name, and also to promote and preserve the Cantonese language.
