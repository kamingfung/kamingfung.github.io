This is an example to show special characters and formats in ggplot2.

In the following example, we are going to show a chemical reaction in a
plot created by "ggplot2". It may seem straightforward but the way R
handling it is not. Let’s see the codes.

``` r
library(ggplot2)  # for plotting

# setting up the base plot
g = ggplot()
g = g + geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 1, label = 'S(IV)["(aq)"]~"+"~H[2]*O[2*"(aq)"] %->% SO[4*"(aq)"]^"2–"~(mode~1)'), parse = T)

g
```

In the code example, we try to pass a string defined for "label" into
the "R" basic function "parse" to convert plain text into an "plot.math"
object, i.e., a chemical equation in this example. There are some
strange symbols in the string and they all carry special function -

  - round brackets "(" and ")" are quoted so that "parse" considers them
    normal characters.
  - "~" and "*" indicate whether linking characters are separated by a
    space or not, respectively.
  - "~" can sometimes be replaced by a space character "  " if there is
    no ambiguity for "parse".
  - "[" and "]" are used to put the containing characters a subscript.
  - "^" is used for super-scripting, and, to put multiple characters
    into one superscription, we need to quote the characters using
    quotation marks """.
  - For an expression with both sub- and superscription, "parse"
    considers them orderly as sub- \> superscription.
  - Finally, "%->%" is the arrow symbol, and a list of such special
    equation symbols can be found in [this website of
    plotmath](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/grDevices/html/plotmath.html).
