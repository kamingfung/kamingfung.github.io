abstract: Moyamoya disease leads to the formation of stenosis in the cerebrovasculature.
  A superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is an effective
  treatment for the disease, yet it is usually associated with postoperative cerebral
  hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS). This study aimed to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic
  changes immediately after surgery and assess whether a semiquantitative analysis
  of an intraoperative magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted image (PWI) is useful
  for predicting postoperative CHS. Fourteen patients who underwent the STA-MCA bypass
  surgery were included in this study. An atlas-based registration method was employed
  for studying hemodynamics in different cerebral regions. Pre- versus intraoperative
  and group-wise comparisons were conducted to evaluate the hemodynamic changes. A
  postoperative increase in relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the terminal MCA
  territory (P = 0.035) and drop in relative mean-time-transit at the central MCA
  territory (P = 0.012) were observed in all patients. However, a significant raise
  in the increasing ratio of relative-CBF at the terminal MCA territory was only found
  in CHS patients (P = 0.023). The cerebrovascular changes of the patients after revascularization
  treatment were confirmed. Intraoperative PWI might be helpful in predicting the
  change in relative-CBF at MCA terminal territory which might indicate a risk of
  CHS.
